## NC Birding Trail Website Redesign 2018

This is a redesign of the North Carolina Birding Trail (www.ncbirdingtrail.org), developed as a Wordpress theme (currently hosted at test.ncbirdingtrail.org). Primarily this will be the new website for the North Carolina, but with potential to be shareable to other trails using the WordPress platform.

### Status
Under Development

### Future Enhancements
* Add wordpress data entry forms for managing site data
* Incorporate site data into wordpress database to eliminate the need for a separate MySQL database
* Add login ability for site managers to manage their information
