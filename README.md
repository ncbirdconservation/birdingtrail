## NC Birding Trail Website Redesign 2018

This is a redesign of the North Carolina Birding Trail website (www.ncbirdingtrail.org), developed as a WordPress theme (currently hosted at http://test.ncbirdingtrail.org). Primarily this will be the new website for the North Carolina, but with potential to be shareable to other trails using the WordPress platform.

### Features
* Mobile optimized using Bootstrap 4.0
* Google Map API
  * Interactive map of birding trail sites with popup displaying information
  * Browser geolocation and storing of user location and platform
  * Fishes for site information using Google Maps Routes and Places API

### Status
Under Development

### Future Enhancements
* Integrate eBird information to guide birders to recently seen species
* Develop dynamically formatted and printable (pdf?) birding lists based on eBird records
* Add wordpress data entry forms for managing site data
* Incorporate site data into wordpress database to eliminate the need for a separate MySQL database
* Add login ability for site managers to manage their information
